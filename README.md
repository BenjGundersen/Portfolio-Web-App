# Overview

For this program, I am trying to make a simple web app. It is a very simple portfolio that showcases some of the past projects I have done in classes. 
I am trying to learn how to create a web app using the Django framework and Python.
To start the Web App:
* Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system.
* Download the repository containing the project files.
* Open a Command Prompt window.
* Navigate to the root directory of the repository files using the ```cd``` command.
* Start the development server by running the command: ```python manage.py runserver```.
* Access the web app by opening your web browser and visiting: ```http://localhost:8000```.

For a quick overview of the program and its functionality, watch the provided Software Demo Video.

# Web Pages

## Home Page
* Just a very simple and basic HTML page that says, "Hello, World!" It also features a button that takes you to the web page that has all the projects listed.

## Projects Page
* Django uses a SQL database to dynamically generate a web page with all the projects listed. It also has a button that takes you back to the home page.

## Project Page
* Django once again uses the SQL database to dynamically generate a web page for each of the projects. It shows the name of the project, a brief description, technology used, and a picture. 
* It also has a button that takes you back to the projects page. 

# Development Environment

I used the following programs to help create this web app:
* JetBrains PyCharm
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code
* Command Prompt

I used the following programming languages and tools to create this web app:
* Python
* HTML
* Django

# Useful Websites

Below is a list of websites I found useful when making this.

* [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/django/index.htm)

# Future Work

Below is a list of things I would like to change/improve upon in the future.
* Better looking home page.
* More projects.
* More data fields for the projects that will show on the individual project page, so that they are more full.
